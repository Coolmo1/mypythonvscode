#In your institution, there was  request to write  python program that checks whether the age input of students are Odd numbers or Even numbers.

# Age = int(input("Enter in your Age: "))
# Agediv= Age % 2

# if Agediv == 0:
#     print("The number is even")
# else:
#     print("The number is odd")

    # Modulo Operator returns the remainder in the division of two numbers. '%'

    # 5 % 2 = 1
    # 9 % 4 = 1
    # 9 % 2 = 1


# x = 3
# y = 0
# print(x or y)

    # Or Operator: it declares or return the first operand when it is TRUE, otherwise it declares the second operand.
    # In python TRUE = non-zero, FALSE = zero.

# x = 3
# y = 2
# print(x or y)

x = 0
y = 2
print(x or y)
